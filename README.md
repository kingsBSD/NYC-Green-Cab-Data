## NYC Green Cab Fare Data, 2015.

Gzipped .csv files of [New-York Green Cab fare data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).
There is a set of many [small files](small_files.md), suitable for uploading into a Jupyter Notebook server. There is
also a smaller set of [larger files](large_files.md) for use with HDFS.

There are Jupyter notebooks available as a guide to experimenting with the data using Apache Spark:

* By uploading the data into [Jupyter](https://github.com/kingsBSD/NYC-Green-Cab-Data/blob/master/nyc_green_cab.ipynb)
* By uploading the data into [HDFS](https://github.com/kingsBSD/NYC-Green-Cab-Data/blob/master/nyc_green_cab_hdfs.ipynb)

There are [instructions](docs/virtual_box.md) for setting up [Ananke](https://github.com/kingsBSD/ananke), our Apache Spark Docker image.
